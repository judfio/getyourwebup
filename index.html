                    <p> I am a native New Yorker, now living in New Jersey with my husband and three children. My experience in tech began at NYU, where I studied for my BA in Computer Science.  After graduation, I worked for JPMorgan and United Parcel Service over a 12 year period. I was involved in every aspect of the development lifecycle, from planning to development to testing.  </p>
                    <p>After taking some time off to be home with my children, I reentered the workforce to become an Assistive Technology Specialist in a school district in Northern NJ. I love my work but I've been longing for a return to my programming roots. I decided to take a course to learn about Front-End Web Development and the site you are looking at was hand crafted for class.</p>
                    <p>While the application may be new, the essential skills of development remain the same as they were in my early career.  <strong>My emphasis continues to be creating applications that work well, adhere to best practices, are easy to maintain, and provide complete satisfaction to the client. </strong></p>
